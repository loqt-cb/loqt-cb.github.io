Hey there.
I think I just figured out how to get a site to work. This jekyll theme stuff can be a real piece of work.

I've dealt with a lot of rejection the past week from a few companies. It does make me start to wonder whether or not I'll get this internship, and ultimately, whether or not things will work out. The solution to this, is to just keep working. Don't stop working, catch up to your competitors, but more importantly, be okay with things not working out.

God is the reason you are here in the first place, never forget that your life isn't truly yours. It's under his control. Whatever he wants to happen will happen.

How to catch up you might wonder? Do a little something extra every day. Don't forget to make it enjoyable and satisfying. If you recall from reading Atomic Habits, you remember that to be more productive, you actually have to want to do it. That's the key difference in success. You will get nowhere if you're reluctant to work.

Just a thought or two. I've been really composed with myself for the past couple of months and I have a lot to thank God for, as well as my parents and friends.
