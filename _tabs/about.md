Welcome to my site! - [My Resume](/assets/docs/CBlakeResumeFB.pdf) 





Hi, I'm Carrick Blake, a cybersecurity student at Kennesaw State University in my Junior year. I'm a very analytical person and I love problem solving, I also have a strong desire to protect and ensure safety for everyone around me; which is why I chose cybersecurity. 

Alongside my education I have obtained two very valuable certifications: CompTIA Security+ and Security Blue BTL1. As well as the Google Cybersecurity certification. I have done many projects in my home lab and cybersecurity sites such as HackTheBox, where I have also developed my documentation skills through posting write-ups for these projects here on this site. 

I'm in search of opportunities to get more experience, learn new skills, and master the ones that I already have. Feel free to reach out at my [Email](mailto:carrick.blake32@gmail.com) or on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/carrick-blake-4973a52a2/) if you'd like to get in contact about anything.
