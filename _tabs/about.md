Welcome to my site! 

Hi, I'm Carrick Blake.
I am a Cybersecurity student at Kennesaw State University in my Junior year. I am searching for an internship that aligns with my values, but will also provide me with an opportunity to grow in my career, so that I can become something great further on in my life. 


Alongside my education I have been receiving hands on experience from my two certifications with Security Blue - Blue Team 1 and Google in Cybersecurity. I am also currently working towards getting Comptia Security+. I have worked multiple jobs that have taught me valuable lessons in crucial soft-skills such as critical thinking, time management, and effective communication. 


I'm a very analytical person and love problem solving, which is why I chose Cybersecurity since it suits my personality. A big reason as to why I made this website was because I wanted a place where I could showcase the tools and critical thinking skills I am learning through completing challenges. I like doing a lot of these challenges off of sites such as HackTheBox and OverTheWire.
