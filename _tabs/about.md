Welcome to my site!

Hi, I'm Carrick Blake.
I am a Cybersecurity student at Kennesaw State University in my Junior year. Currently in search for an internship that will provide me with a meaningful experience and set of knowledge. Alongside my education I have been receiving hands on experience from my two certifications with Security Blue - Blue Team 1 and Google Cybersecurity. I am also currently working towards getting Comptia Security+. I have worked multiple jobs that have taught me valuable lessons in crucial soft-skills such as critical thinking, time management, and effective communication. 

My passion for Cybersecurity started when I was young, learning to do reverse engineering and code injection within some of my favorite video games. This was only the start, and since then my love for it has grown exponentially as I learn more about it. Thank you for taking the time to visit my site!
