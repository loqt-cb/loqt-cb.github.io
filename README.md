This is the repository for my personal cybersecurity [website](https://finalbreach.com). Here I post all things cybersecurity. Topics include: challenge write-ups, tutorials, reviews, and more. This website was created with [Github Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages) and also [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) for theming. If you were interested in making your own website I'd strongly recommend using both to get started. Also a big thank you to [cotes2020](https://github.com/cotes2020) for creating the Chirpy theme and making it open source.
